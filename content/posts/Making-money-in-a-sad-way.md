___I want to place a big disclaimer here: everything you are about to read does not refer to every company or startup you can think of, but still, 80% of them will probably fall into my negative perception.___

As a software engineer, I'm fortunate to work in a field that's both lucrative and in high demand. Or am I just dreaming?

It's a profession that not only sustains me but also thrusts me into the very heart of the digital gold rush. Yet, here’s the unvarnished truth: much of our work in this industry is a cleverly disguised act of mimicry.

We developers like to trumpet our creations as groundbreaking, heralding each project as a fresh innovation. But are we truly inventing anything new? Rarely. The reality is that we often just recycle and repackage old ideas. We look at what others have successfully implemented, tweak it slightly, and then rebrand it as a novel solution. It's not just about building something better; it's about convincing the market that what we offer is the new must-have, even when it’s fundamentally the same as the last must-have.

Our industry is rife with this duplicity. We champion the notion of 'innovation' while quietly scouring our competitors' offerings for 'inspiration'. We're not just developing websites; we're engaged in a silent war of attrition, attempting to outshine and outlast, to capture and sometimes pilfer clientele through slight technological one-upmanship.

What we should be doing is consolidating our efforts. Imagine the potential of a singular, dynamic platform that evolves, adapts, and integrates all these 'revolutionary' ideas into one cohesive system. But no, that concept, while efficient, is antithetical to the ethos of a market driven by competition over actual innovation.

So, we continue to spin our wheels, creating thousands of iterations of the same concept. Each new project is pitched as a bespoke masterpiece, yet beneath the surface, it’s often just a reiteration of something already out there. This cycle is profitable, certainly. It keeps our industry bustling and our jobs secure. Yet, it’s also an exhausting, somewhat disingenuous way to operate.

In withdrawing from the echo chamber of social media, I’ve tried to step back from this relentless cycle of pseudo-innovation. I choose projects that allow for genuine creativity rather than those that merely add to the noise. I aim to develop websites that provide true value, rather than just rehashing old ideas under a new guise.

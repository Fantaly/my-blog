Hello, my name is [Your Name]. I am currently studying reverse engineering for legal purposes and learning English. My focus area is binary exploitation.

### Background

I have a keen interest in understanding how software works at a fundamental level. This has led me to explore reverse engineering, where I dismantle software to see how it functions internally. This process is fascinating and helps in improving my problem-solving skills.

### Interests

- **Reverse Engineering:** Delving into software internals to understand its workings.
- **Binary Exploitation:** Exploring vulnerabilities in binary software for educational and ethical purposes.
- **Learning English:** Continuously improving my English to better understand technical documents and communicate with the global tech community.

### Goals

My main goals are to:

1. **Master Reverse Engineering:** Gain a deep understanding of software internals.
2. **Advance in Binary Exploitation:** Learn advanced techniques and stay updated with the latest developments.
3. **Improve English Proficiency:** Enhance my language skills for better comprehension and communication.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I look forward to sharing my journey and learning from the community.
